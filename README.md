# RPIEmbeddor VS AF3
Scripts to compare RPI prediction tools

### Install environment

##### Install bedtools

apt-get install bedtools

### Objective of the master project

The aim of this project is somehow compare the quality of RNA-Protein interactions (RPI) predictions from a tool specifically for RNA-Protein Interactions versus a more general but powerful tool named AlphaFold3.

To do so, an approach for utilizing AlphaFold3 was taken, this was based mostly on making use of the atomic coordinates generated by the 3D complexes of AlphaFold3. A distance matrix is created where every residue from the protein is obtained a distance with every nucleotide of the RNA.

Another aim of this project is validating somehow the performance of the specialized RPI prediction tool "RPIEmbeddor" from the University of Freiburg Machine Learning Group. To achieve this goal a python script to vary the lengths of RNA chains was created. With this it can be measured the consecuences of inputting RNA sequences of different lengths in the specialized software prediction tool.
